# Arkham Horror LCG: Return to Consternation on the Constellation

### What?
[Return to Consternation on the Constellation](#) is a 'fan-brew' scenario pack designed by the [Arkham.cards](https://patreon.com/arkhamdotcards) team to be compatible with [Arkham Horror: The Card Game](https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/products/arkham-horror-the-card-game/) by [Fantasy Flight Games](https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/). It is a 'rework/fork/relocalization/remake' of another popular 'fan-brew' scenario called Consternation on the Constellation, originally designed by hosts of the Mythos Busters podcasts for GenCon 2019.

The Return to Consternation on the Constellation scenario pack contains one custom scenario which may be played in standalone mode or as part of a large campaign.

### Why?
The original version of Consternation on the Constellation was a very well designed scenario, that we thought suffered from a few small issues that could easily be polished up by a third-party to make it more appealing to a wider range of players. In celebration of The Ghosts of Onigawa's one-year anniverary we thought it would be appropriate to spotlight another fan-brew creator's work that we have enjoyed (and give it a fresh coat of paint in the process.)

### When?
Return to Consternation on the Constellation v1.0 was released on 10/XX/2023.
